<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi.. Bogar's the name. I'm an Indonesian who is always wondering "why I was born as one".  It's not that I'll be happy to be an American (or perhaps a Japanese), it doesn't matter... really. The thing is.. it was never about where I'm belong to, but rather because of my nature of not being able to "fit properly" in any societies. It might be too personal for a starter, but this is an about page after all. I'm assuming that you're visiting this page to know more about me or to take a hint on what kind of person I am. I even plan on visiting this page regularly just to reminds me of myself. Sometime all you need to do is just... write, write for the sake of doing it and the next time you're going back to re-read your piece you'll be amazed on how much you've exposed yourself to the entire world.

  I have my failures, just like you and every single person I can think of. I always failed on being a "social person". Starting with the day when the only chat client you're probably using is Mig33 (no kidding). With your new cutting edge candy bar cellphone and not so comfortable yet practical keypad, you're starting your epic exploration in that newfound sanctuary called "virtual society". It's never gets boring as you're absorbed into the world that --for the very first time-- are eccepting to you. I was hooked, to know that there was actually some actual persons who are willing to spent their time talking to me all the day through. While you might call me a loner for saying so, I always prefer to call myself in a more civilized way such as an introvert. Don't blame someone just because he's different, and don't blame me for being myself.

  I was a gamer whose ayes are always fixed on the screen full of fantasy and adventures. I was inside that world of wonder marely to fill the emptiness that was resided in me, and also to keep my humanity intact. That was the time when I can just run away from reality, the day when I can just sit on my couch all day long playing Final Fantasy series and pretended to be a fulfilled gentlemen. But now, doing that will cause me a lot of trouble.
