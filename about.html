<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi.. Bogar's the name. I'm an Indonesian who is always wondering "why I was born as one".  It's not that I'll be happy to be an American (or perhaps a Japanese), it doesn't matter... really. The thing is.. it was never about where I'm belong to, but rather because of my nature of not being able to "fit properly" in any societies. It might be too personal for a starter, but this is an about page after all. I'm assuming that you're visiting this page to know more about me or to take a hint on what kind of person I am. I even plan on visiting this page regularly just to reminds me of myself. Sometime all you need to do is just... write, write for the sake of doing it and the next time you're going back to re-read your piece you'll be amazed on how much you've exposed yourself to the entire world.

  I have my failures, just like you and every single person I can think of. I always failed on being a "social person". Starting with the day when the only chat client you're probably using is Mig33 (no kidding). With your new cutting edge candy bar cellphone and not so comfortable yet practical keypad, you're starting your epic exploration in that new-found sanctuary called "virtual society". It's never gets boring as you're absorbed into the world that --for the very first time-- are accepting to you. I was hooked, to know that there was actually some "actual persons" who are willing to spent their time talking to me all the day through. While you might call me a loner for saying so, I always prefer to call myself in a more civilized way such as an introvert. Don't blame someone just because he's different, and don't blame me for being myself.

  I was a gamer whose ayes are always fixed on the screen full of fantasy and adventures. I was always go inside that world of wonder merely to fill the emptiness that was resided in me, and also to keep my humanity intact. That was the time when I can just run away from reality, the day when I can just sit on my couch all day long playing Final Fantasy series and pretending to be a fulfilled gentlemen. But now, doing that, of course; will cause me a lot of trouble.

  I do play some games, but only to observe how things work. I exclusively enjoy some genre that focus on the story telling aspect instead of just button mashing madness that doesn't mean anything.For a long time I've been dreaming on becoming a game developer, a person who is, in his live, doing what people called "having fun".  I never imagined it to be so rewarding when I first started my little yet ambitious project. I can do a lot of things in game development, it might be overwhelming on the start but once you're able to follow the process and just do what you like to do; everything will gets better and you'll finally enjoy the task of being a "maker".

  This blog (or website, or whatever you want call it) is meant to be my personal log that contained all of my project notes, documentations, and of course some of my personal thoughts that may or may not be your concern. You might noticed that the organization of my writing is not what they called "tidy". Oh well... denying that is a waste of time, as I'm really not into some kind of argument. Just like my lecturer once said to me on her notes; "Sorry I got confused on how to read your work. Please rewrite it!". So, I will not argue with you. I'll just kindly take my time to rewrite it like I always did. Everybody's happy!
